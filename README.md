# CPM-Diagram-Generator
This project offers a straightforward HTML solution for generating Critical Path Method (CPM) style diagrams. It is meant to be used in project management contexts.

## âœ© Overview
This project provides a drag-and-drop template for creating CPM diagrams with editable text fields. This solution is perfect for users who want a clean, intuitive way to put together CPM diagrams quickly and without the hassle of tediously moving around many task nodes and interestingly shaped arrows. The nodes include a textfield for task duration, making it simple to visualize project timelines.

## âŠ¹ Why This Solution?
Using PowerPoint or similar diagram editing software is too tedious, and drawing diagrams by hand is not very professional looking. This HTML-based approach provides:
* Great control over node structure
* Simplicity in editing by allowing users to click and fill in task durations
* Ease of arrangement to achieve professional-looking diagrams with minimal effort

##  âžœ Usage
1. Open the HTML file in your browser.
2. Specify the number of tasks you want to generate.
3. Input task succession relationships according to the specified format (e.g., "A->B,C" means task A leads to tasks B and C).
4. Adjust the nodes by dragging them to desired positions on the canvas for a clear, cohesive diagram.
5. Click on the duration field to add or change the task duration as needed.

## ð–¦¹ Customization
* Experiment with node placement to achieve an ideal flow and enhance readability.
* Feel free to apply CSS to customize the colors, borders, and layout of your nodes for a unique look.

## âŒ• Troubleshooting
* If nodes overlap or don't align perfectly, try repositioning them to optimize layout.
* If text fields don't seem editable, ensure that you're using a supported browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Hopefully in the Future
I'm hoping to enhance this code to automatically:
* Calculate the critical path based on task duration input
* Highlight critical path tasks in a distinct color
* Provide more detailed project timeline analytics
